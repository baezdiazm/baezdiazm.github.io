I'm a 29 year old guy who grew up in the Dominican Republic, raised by my mother alone, since I was a little child I've always had a very fond interest in solving problems on my own, to figure out solutions to problems or puzzles on my own

My mother would buy me toys that would tend to be more crafty than regular toys or they would be electricity based like remote controlled cars, little radios, among other toys of the same sort. After spending a lot of time playing with them like a regular kid would, I would then try to see what was inside the toys, what made them behave the way they did, what made them move and sound and work properly, I wanted to see if I could take them apart and put them back together.

I can't say with certainty at what age I discovered that passion or interest but it is certain that it was at a very early point in my life. I grew up experimenting with computers, learning how to use them, learning how to disassemble them and put them back together and doing so made me even more curious as to how they worked logically, what made a program work, how could I write one, how do I learn to do it. 

It was then when I realized that I really enjoyed learning this and I'd love to make it a living for myself, so when I found out that Flatiron School existed and offered programs for Software Engineering I immediately jumped to the opportunity. 

Software Engineering is in a way a form of puzzle solving. you have specific actions you need your program to execute and it's your job to figure out how you'll accomplish that, to figure out which lines of code to implement to make it work the way it is intended to, to go back to your code and figure out why it does not work or why it DOES.

I am sure i will not regret taking this step.
